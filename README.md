# Artificial Synapses based on the Photoconductance of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 quantum wells

The presentation is written by Latex. 

The animations are presented in the 
 - Slide 4- Von Neumann Architecture
 - Slide 7- STDP learning rule
 - Slide 21- Lattice-Relaxation model
 - Slide 22- Depletion caused by Quantum tunneling. 
 
 The Adobe PDF reader can run the animations.
